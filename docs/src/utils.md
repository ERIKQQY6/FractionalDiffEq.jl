## What is Fractional Differential Equations?

While the Ordinary Differential Equations and Partial Differential Equations are widely used in enormous areas and play inportant roles in their theoretical analysis, someone may asks, ODE and PDE are enough for nowadays modeling, has FDE any usage in our life?

Well, fractional differential equation can be seen as the generalization of ODE and PDE. In our daily life, models usually are better described in FDE

## A simple example —— Relaxation Oscillation Equation

Let's see a simple model involving fractional differential equations:

```math
D^{1.8}y(t)+y(t)=1,\ (t>0)
\\
y^{(k)}(0)=0
```

## FDE with specific initial value

While the former examples we only use the zero initial value problem, here, we can look at some problems with
