Pkg> add FractionalDiffEq
```

Or if you want to experience the latest version of FractionalDiffEq.jl:

```julia
Pkg> add FractionalDiffEq#master
```

## Plans

* More algorithms are planned to support
* Fractional Partial differential Equations

!!! info "WIP"
		FractionalDiffEq.jl is under heavy construction, some APIs or docs might change a lot.
